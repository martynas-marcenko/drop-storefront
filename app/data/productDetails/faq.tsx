          In the morning, we recommend cleansing with a gentle wash or cream
          cleanser as the skin is relatively clean in comparison with the end of
          day time. In the evening, it would be ideal to double cleanse. Read

      question: 'What is a serum?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Face serums are products that contain a higher concentration of active
          ingredients ‚Äî like hyaluronic acid, antioxidants, and vitamin C. They
          are not designed to replace a moisturizer or toner. Instead, they are
          designed to work with them hand in hand.
          <br />
          <br />
          Think of your serum as your ‚Äúsuperfood‚Äù for the skin.
          <br />
          <br />
          They can come in a variety of different lightweight formulas,
          including gels, oils, emulsions and light creams.‚Å£
          <br />
          <br />
          For best effect, a serum is applied after cleansing and toning but
          before your usual moisturizer, so that active ingredients could create
          a layer of the treatment benefits between the skin and moisturizer.‚ú®‚Å£

          Oils empowers you to cleanse your face without sacrificing the
          skin&apos;s microbiome and achieve clear, balanced skin.
          <br />
          <br />
          How it works
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Oil absorbs oil, which means that oil-based products can
          effectively remove makeup, sunscreen, excess sebum, and other dirt.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. A cleansing oil removes all the bad stuff but still leaves
          protective microbiome - ecosystem of bacteria which covers the
          skin&apos;s surface and is crucial to the health and beauty of your
          skin.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. We formulate our cleansers in a way, that their ingredients add an
          extra boost to protect microbiome and keep moisture barrier strong.

      question: 'Moisturizing vs. Hydrating: what is the difference?',
      answer: (
        <>
          The difference between the two is usually quite blurry in the skincare
          industry, especially, when choosing correct products for your needs.
          Here is a simple explanation of how these two differ but still go hand
          in hand.
          <br />
          <br />‚Å£ üîπ Hydration is the absorption of moisture from the air and
          then infusing your cells with water to improve your skin&apos;s
          ability to absorb moisture and nutrients. There are ingredients, like
          glycerin or hyaluronic acid that attract water from the atmosphere and
          bind it in the skin.
          <br />
          <br />‚Å£ üî∏ While moisturizing is about trapping and locking in the
          moisture to build your skin&apos;s natural protective barrier. It is
          about preventing any water loss and ensuring that your skin remains
          soft and smooth.
          <br />
          <br />
          For example, oils retain water content, but not add into it ‚Äî which
          means they are moisturizing but not hydrating.
          <br />
          <br />
          Both are essential for your skin care. Think of them this way ‚Äì
          hydration is essential to create much needed water, that, in turn,
          makes your skin soft and elastic. However, if hydration escapes, the
          effect will be short-lasting and the skin will still end up dry and
          flaky. This is where moisturizing comes in ‚Äì it ensures that the water
          stays sealed in the skin and prevents it from disappearing so your
          skin becomes smooth and bouncy. üåû‚Å£

      question: 'What‚Äôs the difference between Face oils and Face serums?',
      answer: (
        <>
          While both face oils and faces serum nourish, protect and moisturize
          the skin, face serums have additional benefits. First of all, they
          usually target specific concerns like dryness, pigmentation, redness,
          dullness, etc. Moreover, they contain effective ingredients such as
          antioxidants, vitamins, botanical extracts, anti-inflammatory, toning
          or skin-strengthening elements.
          <br />
          <br />
          To sum up, face oils are great for regular skincare, but if you look
          for an enriched effect with more benefits, face serums are the ones to
          go for.

      question: 'How to double cleanse?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Double cleansing helps you to wash your face more efficiently.
          <br />
          <br />
          How it works
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Use cleansing oil or balm to remove oily make-up, sunscreen and
          natural oils while minimizing the use of irritating surfactants ‚Äì
          which means your microbiome stays happy.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Apply a very gentle water-based cleanser to get rid of any oily
          residue. This step provides the cleaning that we associate with
          traditional face washing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Double cleansing helps you:
          <br />
          <br />
          - Clean deeper without depriving skin‚Äôs natural microbiome.
          <br />
          - Brighten up the skin and make it more glowing.
          <br />- Stay effective with other skincare products as they are
          absorbed and penetrated better.

      question:
        'How to know if the product might cause an allergic reaction to the skin?',
      answer: (
        <>
          First of all, check the ingredients list to see if there are any
          products you are allergic to. Secondly, do a patch test to try out the
          product. <br />
          <br />
          How to do a patch test? <br />
          <br />
          A patch test is intended to assist in determining whether you may
          experience a negative reaction to a product. Doing a patch test is
          important if you have a history of reactions and your skin is
          hypersensitive.
          <br />
          <br />
          Step 1: <br />
          Apply the product to a small patch of skin where you are unlikely to
          wash or rub it anyway. The inside of the arm or the bend of the elbow
          are both suitable areas.
          <br />
          <br />
          Step 2:
          <br />
          Normally, a patch test is left on for 24 hours, but if you are prone
          to reactions, it is best to leave it on for 48 hours so that a delayed
          reaction has chance to manifest. Even better, apply in the same area
          over a few days.
          <br />
          <br />
          Step 3:
          <br />
          If your skin reacts to the product you should wash it and stop using
          it.
