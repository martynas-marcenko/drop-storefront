      question: 'Should I use oil cleanser on the dry skin?',

      question: 'What is a serum?',
      answer: `Face serums are products that contain a higher concentration of active ingredients ‚Äî like hyaluronic acid, antioxidants, and vitamin C. They are not designed to replace a moisturizer or toner. Instead, they are designed to work with them hand in hand.  \n  \nThink of your serum as your ‚Äúsuperfood‚Äù for the skin.  \n  \nThey can come in a variety of different lightweight formulas, including gels, oils, emulsions and light creams.‚Å£  \n  \nFor best effect, a serum is applied after cleansing and toning but before your usual moisturizer, so that active ingredients could create a layer of the treatment benefits between the skin and moisturizer.‚ú®‚Å£`,

      question: 'What is oil cleansing?',
      answer: `Oils empowers you to cleanse your face without sacrificing the skin's microbiome and achieve clear, balanced skin.  \n  \nHow it works  \n  \n1. Oil absorbs oil, which means that oil-based products can effectively remove makeup, sunscreen, excess sebum, and other dirt.  \n  \n2. A cleansing oil removes all the bad stuff but still leaves protective microbiome - ecosystem of bacteria which covers the skin's surface and is crucial to the health and beauty of your skin.  \n  \n3. We formulate our cleansers in a way, that their ingredients add an extra boost to protect microbiome and keep moisture barrier strong. Result? Smooth, luminous, clearer-looking skin ü•∞`,

      question: 'Moisturizing vs. Hydrating: what is the difference?',
      answer: `The difference between the two is usually quite blurry in the skincare industry, especially, when choosing correct products for your needs. Here is a simple explanation of how these two differ but still go hand in hand.  \n  \n‚Å£ üîπ Hydration is the absorption of moisture from the air and then infusing your cells with water to improve your skin's ability to absorb moisture and nutrients. There are ingredients, like glycerin or hyaluronic acid that attract water from the atmosphere and bind it in the skin.  \n  \n‚Å£ üî∏ While moisturizing is about trapping and locking in the moisture to build your skin's natural protective barrier. It is about preventing any water loss and ensuring that your skin remains soft and smooth.  \n  \nFor example, oils retain water content, but not add into it ‚Äî which means they are moisturizing but not hydrating.  \n  \nBoth are essential for your skin care. Think of them this way ‚Äì hydration is essential to create much needed water, that, in turn, makes your skin soft and elastic. However, if hydration escapes, the effect will be short-lasting and the skin will still end up dry and flaky. This is where moisturizing comes in ‚Äì it ensures that the water stays sealed in the skin and prevents it from disappearing so your skin becomes smooth and bouncy. üåû‚Å£`,

      question: 'What‚Äôs the difference between Face oils and Face serums?',

First of all, they\nusually target specific concerns like dryness, pigmentation, redness,\ndullness, etc. Moreover, they contain effective ingredients such as\nantioxidants, vitamins, botanical extracts, anti-inflammatory, toning\nor skin-strengthening elements.\n\n\nTo sum up, face oils are great for regular skincare, but if you look\nfor an enriched effect with more benefits, face serums are the ones to\ngo for.\n`,

      question: 'How to double cleanse?',
      answer: `Double cleansing helps you to wash your face more efficiently.  \n  \nHow it works  \n  \n1. Use cleansing oil or balm to remove oily make-up, sunscreen and natural oils while minimizing the use of irritating surfactants ‚Äì which means your microbiome stays happy.  \n  \n2. Apply a very gentle water-based cleanser to get rid of any oily residue. This step provides the cleaning that we associate with traditional face washing.  \n  \nDouble cleansing helps you:  \n  \n- Clean deeper without depriving skin‚Äôs natural microbiome.  \n- Brighten up the skin and make it more glowing.  \n- Stay effective with other skincare products as they are absorbed and penetrated better.`,

      question:
        'How to know if the product might cause an allergic reaction to the skin?',
      answer: `First of all, check the ingredients list to see if there are any products you are allergic to. Secondly, do a patch test to try out the product.  \n  \nHow to do a patch test?  \n  \nA patch test is intended to assist in determining whether you may experience a negative reaction to a product. Doing a patch test is important if you have a history of reactions and your skin is hypersensitive.  \n  \n**Step 1:**  \nApply the product to a small patch of skin where you are unlikely to wash or rub it anyway. The inside of the arm or the bend of the elbow are both suitable areas.  \n  \n**Step 2:**  \nNormally, a patch test is left on for 24 hours, but if you are prone to reactions, it is best to leave it on for 48 hours so that a delayed reaction has chance to manifest. Even better, apply in the same area over a few days.  \n  \n**Step 3:**  \nIf your skin reacts to the product you should wash it and stop using it.`,
