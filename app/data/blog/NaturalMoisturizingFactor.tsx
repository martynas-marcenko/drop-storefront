          If your skin often feels tight, looks flaky, or gets itchy, that's dry

          The skin is like a friendly gatekeeper that's not super strict. It
          lets a bit of water sneak out from our body into the air, a process

          This little bit of water loss is like a sneak peek into how well our

          keep it happy and healthy.

          Picture your skin as a team of three layers working together. At the
          forefront is the epidermis, followed by the supportive dermis, and
          then the nurturing hypodermis.
        </Text>

        <Text size="text-lg" as="p" className="mb-sm font-serif">
          The topmost layer of your skin, the epidermis, has a very thin outer
          layer called the stratum corneum. Think of it like a brick wall:

          Now, as you understand basic skin structure, let's dive into the NMF

        <Text size="text-lg" as="p" className="mb-sm font-serif">
          NMF (Natural Moisturizing Factor) works like a hydration magnet,
          focusing on attracting and retaining water directly in the skin's
          stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin.
        </Text>

        <Text size="text-lg" as="p" className="mb-sm font-serif">
          It's packed with goodies like amino acids and urea. All these
          molecules have a high water binding capacity, even at a low relative
          humidity, and thus maintain adequate skin hydration, even in a dry
          environment, ensuring your skin stays moisturized from the inside out.

          This action helps to maintain hydration within the stratum corneum,
          the skin's outermost layer, by ensuring water is effectively absorbed
          and kept within the skin cells (corneocytes) to support overall
          moisture levels.

        <Text size="text-lg" as="p" className="mb-sm font-serif">
          These special types of fats are nestled between the dead skin cells
          (corneocytes) in your topmost skin layer, the stratum corneum. Their

              Intercellular lipids act like a sealant that keeps this water from

              Besides holding in moisture, these lipids are like a shield. They

          Unlike NMF, which ensures that moisture is effectively absorbed and

          NMF and intercellular lipids are its perfect partner. While NMF grabs
